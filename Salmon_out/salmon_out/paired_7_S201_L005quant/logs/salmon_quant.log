[2017-11-28 12:24:21.198] [jointLog] [info] Computed 187158 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-11-28 12:24:21.198] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4545962 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-11-28 12:24:21.256] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4545962 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
