[2017-11-28 12:24:13.173] [jointLog] [info] Computed 80284 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-11-28 12:24:13.173] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1309961 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-11-28 12:24:13.239] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1309961 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
