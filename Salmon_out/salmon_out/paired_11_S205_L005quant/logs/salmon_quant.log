[2017-11-28 12:24:40.584] [jointLog] [info] Computed 170220 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-11-28 12:24:40.584] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2739579 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-11-28 12:24:40.641] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2739579 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
