[2017-11-28 12:23:43.047] [jointLog] [info] Computed 34127 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-11-28 12:23:43.047] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1603256 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-11-28 12:23:43.117] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1603256 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
